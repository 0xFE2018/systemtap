This is an automated source build of the SystemTap_Tapset_Reference Guide, 
used to build it in Publican.

To build the DocBook XML source (required by Publican), run:

	bash publicanize.sh

This will copy and clean the XML source of SystemTap_Tapset_Reference 
created by kernel-doc. You can now build it in pdf, html, etc using 
Publican. 

The main source of the Language Reference Guide is:

	../SystemTap_Tapset_Reference/tapsets.xml

This main source is generated by kernel-doc when you run 'make' in the
main git tree. The tapset documentation inside is collected from all 
tapset files defined in the following template file:

	../SystemTap_Tapset_Reference/tapsets.tmpl

The tapset file definitions appear in tapsets.tmpl as:

	!Itapset/context.stp
	!Itapset/context-symbols.stp
	etc

context.stp, context-symbols, and all the other tapset files are located in:

	../../tapset

All tapset documentation should be done inside their respective tapset files.
