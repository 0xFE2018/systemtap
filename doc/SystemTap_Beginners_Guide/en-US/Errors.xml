	<title>Understanding SystemTap Errors</title>

	<remark>By type - http://sourceware.org/systemtap/tutorial/node23.html</remark>
	
	<para>This chapter explains the most common errors you may encounter while using SystemTap.</para>
	
<section id="parsetype">
	<title>Parse and Semantic Errors</title>
	
<para>These types of errors occur while SystemTap attempts to parse and
      translate the script into C, prior to being converted into a kernel
      module. For example type errors result from operations that assign invalid
      values to variables or arrays.
</para>
	
<formalpara><title>parse error: expected <replaceable>foo</replaceable>, saw <replaceable>bar</replaceable></title>
	
<para>The script contains a grammatical/typographical error. SystemTap detected type of construct that is incorrect, given the context of the probe.
</para>
</formalpara>

<remark>need more clarification (example) on this; could not replicate. how to
      replicate?</remark>

<para>
      The following invalid SystemTap script is missing the the probe
      handlers:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
<xi:include parse="text" href="extras/perror.stp" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
      It results in the following error message showing that the parser was
      expecting something other than the <command>probe</command> in column 1 of
      line 2:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
parse error: expected one of '. , ( ? ! { = +='
	saw: keyword at perror.stp:2:1
1 parse error(s).
</programlisting>
</para>

<formalpara><title>parse error: embedded code in unprivileged script</title>

<para>
	The script contains unsafe embedded C code (blocks of code
	surrounded by <command>%{</command> <command>%}</command>. SystemTap
	allows you to embed C code in a script, which is useful if there are no
	tapsets to suit your purposes. However, embedded C constructs are not be
	safe; as such, SystemTap warns you with this error if such constructs
	appear in the script.
</para>
</formalpara>
<para>
      If you are sure of the safety of any similar constructs in the script
      <emphasis>and</emphasis>
      are member of <command>stapdev</command> group (or have root privileges),
      run the script in "guru" mode by using the option <command>-g</command>
      (i.e. <command>stap -g <replaceable>script</replaceable></command>).
</para>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: type mismatch for identifier '<replaceable>foo</replaceable>' ... string vs. long</title>

<para>
	The function <command><replaceable>foo</replaceable></command> in the
	script used the wrong type
	(i.e. <command>%s</command> or <command>%d</command>). This error will
	present itself in <xref linkend="errorvariable"/>, because the function
	<command>execname()</command> returns a string the format specifier
	should be a <command>%s</command>, not <command>%d</command>. 
</para>
</formalpara>

<example id="errorvariable">
	<title>error-variable.stp</title>
<programlisting>
probe syscall.open
{
  printf ("%d(%d) open\n", execname(), pid())
}
</programlisting>
</example>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: unresolved type for identifier '<replaceable>foo</replaceable>'</title>
<para>The identifier (e.g. a variable) was used, but no type (integer or
	string)could be determine. This occurs, for instance, if you use a
	variable in a <command>printf</command> statement while no other
	function in the script can assign a value to it.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: Expecting symbol or array index expression</title>
<para>
	SystemTap could not assign a value to a variable or to a location in an
	array. The destination for the assignment is not a valid destination.
	The following example code would generate this error:
</para>
</formalpara>
<para>
<programlisting>
<xi:include parse="text" href="extras/werror.stp" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />
</programlisting>
</para>

<formalpara>
	<title>while searching for arity <replaceable>N</replaceable> function, semantic error: unresolved function call</title>
<para>A function call or array index expression in the script used an invalid
	number of arguments/parameters. In SystemTap
	<firstterm>arity</firstterm> can either refer to the number of indices
	for an array, or the number of parameters to a function.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: array locals not supported:</title>
	<para>The script used an array operation without declaring the array as
	a global variable (global variables can be declared after their use in
	Systemtap scripts). Similar messages appear if an array is used, but with inconsistent arities.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: variable ’<replaceable>foo</replaceable>’ modiﬁed during ’foreach’</title>
	<para>The array <literal>foo</literal> is being modifed (being assigned to or deleted from) within an active <command>foreach</command> loop. This error also displays if an operation within the script performs a function call within the <command>foreach</command> loop.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: probe point mismatch at position <replaceable>N</replaceable>, while resolving probe point <replaceable>foo</replaceable></title>
	<para>SystemTap did not understand what the event or SystemTap function
	<computeroutput><replaceable>foo</replaceable></computeroutput> refers
	to. This usually means that SystemTap could not find a match for
	<computeroutput><replaceable>foo</replaceable></computeroutput> in the
	tapset library. The <replaceable>N</replaceable> refers to the column
	the error occurred in.</para>
</formalpara>	
	
<remark>how to explain N in previous? "The divergence from the “tree” of probe point namespace is at position N (starting with zero at left)." (from tutorial) </remark>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: no match for probe point, while resolving probe point <replaceable>foo</replaceable></title>
	<para>The events / handler function <computeroutput><replaceable>foo</replaceable></computeroutput> could not be resolved altogether, for a variety of reasons. This error occurs when the script contains the event <command>kernel.function("<replaceable>blah</replaceable>")</command>, and <command><replaceable>blah</replaceable></command> does not exist. In some cases, the error could also mean the script contains an invalid kernel file name or source line number.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: unresolved target-symbol expression</title>
	<para>A handler in the script references a target variable, but the value of the variable could not be resolved. This error could also mean that a handler is referencing a target variable that is not valid at all in the context when it was referenced. </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: libdwﬂ failure </title>
	<para>There was a problem processing the debugging information. In most
	cases, this error results from the installation of a
	<filename>kernel-debuginfo</filename> RPM whose version does not match
	the probed kernel exactly. The installed <filename>kernel-debuginfo</filename> RPM itself may have some consistency / correctness problems.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara>
	<title>semantic error: cannot find <replaceable>foo</replaceable> debuginfo</title>
	<para>SystemTap could not find a suitable <filename>kernel-debuginfo</filename> at all. </para>
</formalpara>

<section id="runtimeerror">
	<title>Run Time Errors and Warnings</title>
	<para>
		Runtime errors and warnings occur when the SystemTap
		instrumentation has been installed and is collecting data on
		the system.
	</para>

<formalpara><title>WARNING: Number of errors: <replaceable>N</replaceable>, skipped probes: <replaceable>M</replaceable></title>
<para>
	Errors and/or skipped probes occurred during this run. Both 
	<replaceable>N</replaceable> and <replaceable>M</replaceable> are
	the counts of the number of probes that were not executed due to
	conditions such as too much time required to execute event handlers over
	an interval of time.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>division by 0</title>
<para>
	The script code performed an invalid division.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>aggregate element not found</title>
<para>
	An statistics extractor function other than <command>@count</command>
	was invoked on an aggregate that has not had any values accumulated yet.
	This is similar to a division by zero.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>aggregation overflow</title>
<para>
    An array containing aggregate values contains too many distinct key tuples at this time.
</para>
</formalpara>


<formalpara><title>MAXNESTING exceeded</title>
<para>
	Too many levels of function call nesting were attempted.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>MAXACTION exceeded</title>
<para>
    The probe handler attempted to execute too many statements.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>kernel/user string copy fault at
      <replaceable>ADDR</replaceable></title>
<para>
	The probe handler attempted to copy a string from kernel or
	user space at an invalid address (<replaceable>ADDR</replaceable>.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>pointer dereference fault</title>
<para>
	There was a fault encountered during a pointer
	dereference operation such as a target variable evaluation.
</para>
</formalpara>
