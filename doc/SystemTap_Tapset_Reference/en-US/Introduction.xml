		SystemTap is a tracing and probing tool that allows users to
		study and monitor the activities of the operating system
		(particularly, the kernel) in fine detail. It provides
		information similar to the output of tools like
		<command>netstat</command>, <command>ps</command>,
		<command>top</command>, and <command>iostat</command>; however,
		SystemTap is designed to provide more filtering and analysis
		options for collected information.
