This is a framework for profiling systemtap scripts and the
underlying runtime functions.

To try the tests:
>make
./run_bench
./stap_bench

You will need ruby installed. "yum install ruby" or "up2date ruby" to get it.

---- FILES ----
a.st - sample script test file
b.st - sample script test file

itest.c - used by tests. Type "make" to build
Makefile - makefile for itest

run_bench - test driver with some test scripts. Tests may
be supplied in files (as in a.st and b.st) or in strings, as
in this example.

stap_bench - test driver that tests all files ending in ".st"

bench.rb - bench classes used by drivers.

results.txt - Some results of "run_bench" on different machines.
