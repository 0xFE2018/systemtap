Sample probe.

To build, edit the path in buildit and the addresses in struct dtr_probes
in dtr.c Then "source buildit"

This is a translation of on an old dtr probe:

global {
  long @opens[string];
  sum @reads[string], @writes[string];
}

probe sys_open:entry {
  @opens[current->comm]++;
}

probe sys_read:entry {
  @reads[current->comm] << count;
}

probe sys_write:entry {
  @writes[current->comm] << count;
}
