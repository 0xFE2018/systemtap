/** @mainpage SystemTap Runtime Library
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The SystemTap Runtime Library consists of all functions
 * and code fragments needed by the compiler/translator to
 * include in building a kernel module using kprobes.
 *
 * @section design_sec Design
 * @subsection map_sec Maps (Associative Arrays)
 * Maps are implemented as hash lists. It is not expected that users will
 * attempt to collect so much data in kernel space that performance problems will require
 * more complex solutions such as AVL trees.
 *
 * Maps are created with _stp_map_new().  Each map can hold only one type of 
 * data; int64, string, or statistics.  Each element belonging to a map can have up to 2 keys
 * and a value.  Implemented key types are strings and longs.
 *	
 * To simplify the implementation, the functions to set the key and the functions to set the data are separated.
 * That means we need only 4 functions to set the key and 3 functions to set the value. 
 *
 * For example:
 * @include map.c

 * All elements have a default value of 0 (or NULL).  Elements are only saved to the map when their value is set
 * to something nonzero.  This means that querying for the existance of a key is inexpensive because
 * no element is created, just a hash table lookup.
 *
 * A list is a special map which has internally ascending long integer keys.  Adding a value to
 * a list does not require setting a key first. See _stp_list_add_str() and _stp_list_add_int64().
 *
 * @section status_sec Status
 * Maps are implemented and tested. Histograms are not yet finished.
 * 
 * Copy_From_User functions are done.
 *
 * If maps overflow or memory runs out for some reason, globals are set but nothing is done yet.
 * I expect to implement a function to tell the system to either ignore it or unload the module and quit.
 *
 * @section probe_sec Example Probes
 * 
 * Working sample probe code using the runtime is in runtime/probes.
 *
 * 
 * @section todo_sec ToDo 
 * \link todo Click Here for Complete List \endlink
 * The Runtime Library is not actually a library yet.  It is just a collection of functions 
 * included in the probe boilerplate. Maybe it should stay that way to allow the translator
 * more flexibility in what is included.
