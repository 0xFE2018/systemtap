	* librelay.c: Large refactoring, important changes are
	added transport_mode command, for relayfs transport
	display results only when probe completes and/or write
	output file, merge, sort and delete the per-cpu files
	in postprocessing, refactor so that relayfs files aren't
	created until transport command received, removed sigalrm,
	read the final subbuffers on exit

	* stpd.c: Remove all command-line args except for -p
	and -q as well as all code related to buffer sizes.
