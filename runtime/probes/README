/** @dir probes
This directory contains working example probes that demonstrate and test
the runtime library. They are tested on i386 and x86_64.
*/

To build all probes, just type "./build"
To clean up, "./build clean"
To see a verbose build "./build -v"

The same commands work in any probe subdirectory.
