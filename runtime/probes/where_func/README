This is a silly little instrumentation routine to instrument functions
entry by name. It makes use of the SystemTap runime libraries break
down the number of times the function by caller. It also uses
__print_symbol to map the address back to locations in functions.

By default it instruments schedule().

The instrumentation module is built by having the kernel that is going
to be instrumented currently on the machine and doing "./build"

The instrumentation is inserted as root with:

/sbin/insmod kprobe_funct_where.ko funct_name=function_name

The instrumentation is removed as root with:

/sbin/rmmod kprobe_funct_where
