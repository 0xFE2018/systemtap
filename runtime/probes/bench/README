This is a benchmark program for the SystemTap Runtime.

It works by instrumenting sys_read() and sys_write().  It calls each a million
times and times that.  Then it puts an empty kprobe on one and jprobe on the 
other and times that.  Subtracting the difference between the two runs gives 
the kprobe and jprobe overhead.  The process is then repeated for more 
complicated probes.

Any system has some background activity going on that will generate sys_read 
and sys_write calls. However, unless some major activity is going on, it 
should be statistically insignificant.

To Start:

1. Build the test program.
> gcc -O3 -o time time.c

2. Run the benchmarks
> ./run_bench
