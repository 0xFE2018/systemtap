This is a benchmark program for the SystemTap Runtime.

It works by instrumenting sys_uid() and sys_gid().  It calls each a million
times and measures how long it takes.  Then it puts an empty kprobe on one and jprobe on the 
other and measures that.  Subtracting the difference between the two runs gives 
the kprobe and jprobe overhead.  The process is then repeated for more 
complicated probes.

To Start:

1. Build the test program.
> gcc -O3 -o time time.c

2. Run the benchmarks
> ./run_bench
