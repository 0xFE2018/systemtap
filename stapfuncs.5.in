.SH NAME
stapfuncs \- systemtap functions

.SH DESCRIPTION
The following sections enumerate the public functions provided by
standard tapsets installed under /usr/share/systemtap/tapset.  Each
function is described with a signature, and its behavior/restrictions.
The signature line includes the name of the function, the type of
its return value (if any), and the names and types of all parameters.
The syntax is the same as printed with the 
.IR stap " option " -p2 .
Examples:

.TP
example1:long (v:string, k:long)
Function "example1" does something with the given string and integer.
It returns some integer.

.TP
example2:unknown ()
Function "example2" does something.  There is no explicit return value
and it takes no parameters.

.SS LOGGING
